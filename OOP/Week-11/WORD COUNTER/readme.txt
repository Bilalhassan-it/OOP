Problem Restatement (in easy words)

You have to write a Python program that:

Takes a sentence or list of words as input (words separated by spaces).

Counts how many times each word appears.

Prints the result.

✅ Example Run:
Enter some words separated by spaces: apple banana apple orange banana apple

Word Frequency:
apple : 3
banana : 2
orange : 1

Learn (OOP Concepts)

Class → Blueprint (here: WordCounter).

Object → Instance of class (here: counter).

Attributes → Data stored in object (text, word_count).

Methods → Functions inside class (count_words, display_counts).

Encapsulation → Code is grouped logically inside a class.
